# _What is Juniper?_

# Behavioral health is broken.

The fact that this is a cliche doesn't make it less true — we think it makes it all the more important. We're all paying too much for care that's low quality and too infrequent given the resources we have at our fingertips. We think it all boils down to a single issue...

## It's a supply problem.

In our chosen starting niche, autism, the demand has increased 4000% in the past decade. Supply isn't meeting it. **_Most of the clinics on our platform today have waitlists at least as long as the current number of patients they're seeing._**

It's unsurprising that care is low quality and too expensive — there's just not enough of it.

## We think this is a problem worth solving, and we think we might know how to solve it.

If demand is greater than supply, just increase supply, right? Easier said than done, but we have a strong hypothesis about how we can make a difference:

### 1. Save clinicians time

We've heard time and time again how clinicians are spending ~20 hours / month doing non clinical tasks (billing, scheduling, intake, etc.). If we build software to automate this, these clinicians can see more patients. We do this for everyone, and we've already increased supply by ~18% without adding a single new clinician. And plus, who ever went into behavioral health to do the billing?

### 2. Help clinics recruit, train, and retain talent

We can automate as much as possible, but at the end of the day, we need more practitioners. We're building a recruiting and training technology platform to encourage more folks to enter the behavioral health space, so those who need it can get the care they need.

## We want you to help us solve this problem.

If you think this problem is worth solving, we want you on this journey with us. **But our journey to change behavioral health isn't just a job — it starts with us and how we operate.** This means we have to do a few things differently from most startups:

- Behavioral health has to be something we live and breathe — all four members of the Juniper founding team see therapists every week, and we think you should too (we have a specific benefit to help pay out of pocket costs).
- We're committed as a team to preventing burnout — results over work is one of our core values, and we won't ever expect you to be online at all kinds of weird hours of the night.
- We've focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion from day 0. Currently, half our founding team identifies as female and our cap table includes over a dozen women. Next time you interview with a startup, ask them how many women are on their cap table — this isn't a competition, but we're pretty sure you're going to be disappointed. We still have work to do, particularly when it comes to people of color, and we want you on our journey with us.
- We have to have a sense of humor. Healthcare is so broken, it's depressing if you don't laugh with us.
